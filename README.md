# Taiwanese-Bankruptcy-Prediction

This project analyzes data regarding the critical problem of corporate bankruptcy prediction, utilizing a dataset of Taiwanese companies, which is characterized by severe class imbalance. The analysis is performed using the scikit-learn library in a Python environment. To manage high dimensionality, feature selection methods such as T-test and the LASSO algorithm are applied and evaluated. Concurrently, the issue of data imbalance is addressed through sampling techniques. Within the scope of this research, various classification algorithms are examined and compared to extract results regarding their performance. Following a comparative review of the results, the optimal combination of sampling and modeling is identified, upon which hyperparameter optimization techniques are applied. Finally, appropriate metrics are determined based on the nature of the problem, and an optimal decision threshold is defined for effective credit risk management.
