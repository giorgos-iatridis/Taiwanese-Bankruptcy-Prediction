# Taiwanese-Bankruptcy-Prediction

This project develops a predictive model for corporate bankruptcy using financial ratios from Taiwanese companies. The core challenge involves extreme class imbalance, addressed through hybrid feature selection (T-test & LASSO) and Random Undersampling. The final model, a fine-tuned Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), is optimized for High Recall (95%) to minimize credit risk.
